 * Memory of sixty four 16-bit registers.
 * If load is asserted, the value of the register selected by
 * address is set to in; Otherwise, the value does not change.
 * The value of the selected register is emitted by out.

RAM8 Access: 
The upper 3 bits of the address (address[3..5]) determine 
which RAM8 module will output data.

Mux8Way16 (Multiplexer): 
The output of each RAM8 module is passed through a Mux8Way16 multiplexer, 
which selects one of the outputs based on the upper 3 bits of the address. 
The selected RAM8 moduleâ€™s output is passed to the next stage.

8-way demultiplexor:
 * [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h] = [in, 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0] if sel = 000
 *                            [0, in,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0] if sel = 001
 *                            [0,  0, in,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0] if sel = 010
 *                            [0,  0,  0, in,  0,  0,  0,  0] if sel = 011
 *                            [0,  0,  0,  0, in,  0,  0,  0] if sel = 100
 *                            [0,  0,  0,  0,  0, in,  0,  0] if sel = 101
 *                            [0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, in,  0] if sel = 110
 *                            [0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, in] if sel = 111
